# [@adiq](https://github.com/adiq) dotfiles

💻 Personal macOS setup.

Based on wonderful work of [@square](https://github.com/square) and [@rutgerfarry](https://github.com/rutgerfarry).

## What's in it?

You can see list of all packages and apps installed in:
- `Brew-bundle` for things installed with Homebrew
- `Cask-bundle` for things installed with Cask
- `Mas-bundle` for things installed from Mac App Store with MAS

Also, there are my custom aliases in file `zsh_aliases`.

## Install
```sh
rake
```

## Update
```sh
rake
```

## Customize

If you want to keep similar macOS environment setup yourself, feel free to fork and customize to your ❤️'s content

## Uninstall

rake uninstall
```

> Note: that this won't remove everything, but your linked files should be reset to whatever it was before installing. Some uninstallation steps will be manual.
